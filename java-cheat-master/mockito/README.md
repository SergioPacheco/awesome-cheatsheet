# Mockito

Dominant mocking library.

## Eclipse debugging

If you debug mocks spies with Eclipse, things get annoying because you step into a lot of Mockito boilerplate.

TODO how to avoid it?

- a step filter `org.mockito.*` as explained at: <http://eclipsesource.com/blogs/2011/10/17/effective-mockito-part-4/> did not work well for me. It skips all the interesting part of the code.

# Source top level

Hello world with the `Main.java` file on the current directory.

The magic words are:

    <build>
      <sourceDirectory>.</sourceDirectory>

Useful for very simple projects that don't need much boilerplate.

Likely to break with action that is not extremely basic or third party.
